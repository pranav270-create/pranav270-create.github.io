    <p><em>Disclaimer: this piece contains no argument or position. It simply states and asks.</em></p>
    <p>When I was nine years old, I woke up every night for three months and sobbed about what happens when we die. The question was less personal and more metaphysical: what is at the end? While I have yet to resolve the query, in my life, I have found great solace in reasoning about the extremes; be it black holes in physics, countable and uncountable infinities in math, or Mary's Room in philosophy, I have found that extremes stress test rational world models which inevitably leads to their strengthening.</p>
    <p>One limit I find fascinating is the universe on a cosmic scale. As gravitational waves imply the decay of orbital trajectories via energy loss, does everything collapse into a blackhole? But then coupled with hawking radiation and the rate of universe expansion (yet to be proven to be constant or accelerating as far as I know) do they all end up as minute particles of dust, ripped apart by a force greater than them? What is the nature of mass? Does the Higgs-Boson self-interaction lead to quantum fluctuations that renders matter unstable on a large timescale? None of these questions are grounded in the mundane and undoubtedly their answers will dance to a tune much slower than my lifespan, but still they manage to captivate the attention of humanity. It seems to me that we were born to reason about the limit.</p>
    <p>And what of our own limit? Will humanity continue to integrate increasingly omniscient AI within every product until we finally connect it to our own? Do we then, vis-a-vis intelligence and automation, enable control over biology, chemistry, and ultimately, physics. By thinking “let there be light” can we initiate and orchestrate the origination of a sun? Of course, all of this, even in the limit, will be bound by the nature of physics. We cannot alter the conservation of energy nor the speed of light, but we may well be able to expand our operating envelope until it collides against it.</p>
