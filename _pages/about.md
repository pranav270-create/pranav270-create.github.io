Hi, my name is Pranav Iyer.

I believe in a world where smarter, data-driven decisions are leveraged to improve human outcomes, from healthcare and clean energy to space and automation. 

I have a deep background in mathematics, machine learning, and hands-on robotics. My current research focuses on AI and control theory for unmanned ground robotic systems in complex, unseen environments. I also research the optimization of cyber physical systems through deep learning techniques. I am familiar with SoTA techniques for computer vision, natural language processing (LLMs), graph networks, and PDEs.

My personal work revolves around combining generative and discriminative AI to achieve better healthcare decisions for patients and reduce burden on clinical providers. I also enjoy tinkering with generative AI, art, and robotics.
