Hi, my name is Pranav Iyer.

I believe in a world where smarter, data-driven decisions are leveraged to improve human outcomes, from healthcare and clean energy to space and automation. 

I have a deep background in mathematics, machine learning, and hands-on robotics. In college I majored in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, while minoring in Engineering Biology, Computer Science, and Financial Engineering. After graduation, I worked on DARPA projects, researching the nexus of AI and control theory for unmanned ground robotic systems in complex, unseen environments. I also researched the optimization of high-dimensional, mixed-feature systems, like drones and submarines, through deep learning techniques. 

Today, I am focused on building the next-generation of energy infrastructure to support a scalable human civilization.

In my lifetime, I am interested in creating synthetic intelligence.
