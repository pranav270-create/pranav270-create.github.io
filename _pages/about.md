Hi, my name is Pranav Iyer.

I believe in a world where technology is leveraged to improve human outcomes, from healthcare and clean energy to space and automation.

I have a deep background in mathematics, machine learning, and hands-on robotics. In college I majored in mechanical and aerospace engineering, while minoring in computer science, engineering biology, and optimization.

After graduation, I worked with DARPA, researching the nexus of AI and control theory for robotic systems in unseen terrestrial environments. I also applied deep learning to the optimization of high-dimensional, mixed-feature systems, like drones and submarines and worked on models that can understand patient data to improve clinical decision making.

Today, I am focused on building the next-generation of energy infrastructure to support a scalable human civilization. In my lifetime, I am interested in creating robust synthetic intelligence.
