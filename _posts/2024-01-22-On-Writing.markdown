*Foreword: this used to be called “Why I Began Writing…(Publicly)” ... then I got frustrated in the process of making the website and felt that the current title was more apt*

My first love was playing outside. The combination of nature and the thrill of competitive sports made me feel the most human, tapping into the primal wiring evolution had granted me over millions of years. My second love was reading. I started coming home and curling up with a book for hours on end, ignoring all sense of time, hunger, and thirst. It was only recently that I found my third love: writing.

I suspect this is the product of many factors, but I can most clearly identify two. 

The first is my surrounding culture. As ex-pats from India who grew up without the ample opportunities afforded to my brother and I, my parents prized the value of reading and knowledge. They quite literally walked miles to reach libraries and would eagerly await borrowing a new book. Consequently, my family places a heavy emphasis on reading, viewing it as a portal for social mobility, intellectual growth, and all around self-improvement. As an (arguably) fortunate graduate of an ivy-league education, a similar environment pervaded in college. As a freshman, I partook in the humanities sequence, which read around 900 pages per week of philosophy, history, religion, arts, and various social sciences. While enjoyable, it was akin to hawking radiation: information going mostly in, with a little coming out.

The second was my opinion on opinions. In high school I was an avid debater, which forced me to examine the nuance in both sides of an argument. This led to me concluding that people who have forcible opinions are idiots, and subconsciously led to a distaste of writing as a formalization of opinion; words are free flowing, but etching them in paper felt permanent.

It was only when I began widening my worldview that I realized two things: 

1.Not having an opinion is a privilege

While I still believe in the nuance of argument, I ultimately think highly intelligent individuals are able to weigh the conflicting factors and reach a conclusion with conviction. Not having an opinion is either an inability to do that or the product of purposeful and/or accidental ignorance, a vestige of not needing to care about the issue due to the insular nature of some lives. Listening to Chamath Palihapitiya discuss Warren Buffet’s investing strategy on All-In, I heard some paraphrase of the words “bet hard but be ready to pivot fast”. The same applies with opinions under Bayes’ Rule: hold an opinion that is consistent with the current body of evidence, but update your belief in light of new evidence. Ultimately, I found writing to be a helpful medium for opinion formation by forcibly analyzing the evidence as it currently stands.

2.Writing is a leveraged medium for creation

A couple years ago, I was fortunate enough to rub shoulders with an unnamed investor who was building out his “Second Brain”. It was my first time hearing the concept, but it stuck, and I began organizing my thoughts in Notion and Obsidian. I had also just read Richard Sutton’s “The Bitter Lesson”, and I felt that the pillars of ‘search and learning’ should also apply to humans. I began writing as an opportunity for thought distillation, but found that organized writing was an opportunity for “search” across those thoughts.

Now to address the (publicly). I have been writing for 3 years now, and only recently felt the push to put things on a personal website. I had a deep seated aversion for self-promotion and marketing, siding more with the Musk-esque ethos of “build great product and see what follows”. However, as I read and re-read Yuval Noah Hariri’s “Sapiens” the golden number for mammals felt important: the ability to form social ties via gossip fizzles out around 150 individuals. Only humans can imagine causes and beliefs that do not tangibly exist, thereby forming connections across nation-states, economies, or political and religious ideals, etc.

Similarly, when studying nucleation theory in a material science class, I remember reveling at a curious tidbit: The ratio between the volumetric free energy and surface free energy of a molecule determines its crystallization trajectory. If you have many tiny clusters but they don’t meet, nothing happens. If you have a couple clusters grow big enough to connect with other nucleation sites, you suddenly hit an exponential. Building a great team takes time and reach. It takes nucleation. By publicly highlighting some of my thoughts, interests, and aspirations, I hope that I can connect with like-minded individuals, and reduce the activation energy needed to crystallize.

Lastly, while I still enjoy litmus testing my ideas and theories in person amongst my close friends, I cannot help but respect the law of large numbers. By putting my ideas out there publicly, I eagerly welcome any and all criticism. If viewed as a machine learning problem, larger and more diverse datasets will lead to better gradient feedback, and hence a better predictive network: in this case, my perspective.

The articles here are not extensive but merely some samples of things that I find interesting or fascinating. I hope you enjoy the read and thanks for visiting!
