    I'm the founder of TinyGrid, a company that is reinventing the way we generate and consume energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are reducing the cost to build and operate renewable projects by 100x with a novel combination of AI-powered hardware and software. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to scale human civilization by driving the cost of energy to zero and the availability of energy to infinity. Atomize everything.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before this, I was a roboticist for DARPA and deployed algorithms on military grade hardware. Before that I was an AI reseacher at Princeton and an Aerospace engineer at NASA.

    I am obsessed with creating synthetic intelligence (world models, quality diversity, neurosymbolic learning), the optimal organization of man in society (plato's republic, the conservative sensibility, bhagavad gita), creating art and evoking human emotion (links coming soon), and playing any sport imagineable.
