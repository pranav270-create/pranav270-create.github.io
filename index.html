    I'm the founder of TinyGrid, a company that is reinventing the way we generate and consume energy.
    <br>
    We reduce the cost to build and operate renewable projects by 100x by using a novel combination of hardware and software. 
    <br>
    We hope to scale human civilization by making driving the cost of energy to zero and the availability of energy to infinity.

    Before this, I worked as an AI reseacher for DARPA and deployed algorithms on real hardware systems. I've also worked as an aerospace engineer at NASA and AI reseacher at Cleveland Clinic and Princeton.
