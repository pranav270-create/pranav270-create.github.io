    I'm the founder of TinyGrid, a company that is reinventing the way we generate and consume energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are reducing the cost to build and operate renewable projects by 100x with a novel combination of hardware and software. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to scale human civilization by driving the cost of energy to zero and the availability of energy to infinity. Atomize everything.
    <br>

    Before this, I was an AI engineer for DARPA and deployed algorithms on military grade hardware. Before that I was an AI reseacher at Princeton and aerospace engineer at NASA.

    I am obsessed with creating synthetic intelligence, the optimal organization of society, creating art and evoking human emotion, and (almost) all metaphysical thought.
