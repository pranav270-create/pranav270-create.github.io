    <div class="intro">
      After graduation, I worked with DARPA, researching the nexus of AI and control theory for robotic systems in unseen terrestrial environments. I also applied deep learning to the optimization of high-dimensional, mixed-feature systems, like drones and submarines and worked on models that can understand patient data to improve clinical decision making.
      Today, I am focused on building the next-generation of energy infrastructure to support a scalable human civilization. In my lifetime, I am interested in creating robust synthetic intelligence.
