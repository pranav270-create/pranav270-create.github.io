    I'm the founder of TinyGrid, a company that is reinventing the way we generate and consume energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    We are reducing the cost to build and operate renewable projects by 100x with a novel combination of hardware and software. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We hope to scale human civilization by driving the cost of energy to zero and the availability of energy to infinity. Atomize everything.
    <br>

    Before this, I was an AI engineer for DARPA and deployed algorithms on military grade hardware. Before that I was an AI reseacher at Princeton and aerospace engineer at NASA.

    I am obsessed with creating synthetic intelligence (world models and rl, quality diversity, neurosymbolic learning, graph networks), the optimal organization of society (plato's republic, conservative sensibility type), creating art and evoking human emotion (gotta link these soon), and (almost) all metaphysical thought.
