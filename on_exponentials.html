    <h2>Exponential Growth and Technology</h2>
    <!-- <img class="top-right" src="/images/exponentials.jpeg" alt="Exp Image" width="470" height="200"> -->

    <p>A concept I never quite grasped was exponential growth. And by that I mean I understood the mathematics, but could never actually get a deeper non-logical intuition behind it. It turns out my shortcoming is largely due to our primate hardware. I suppose the pressures of evolution never necessitated reasoning around large numbers or non-linear growth rates.</p>

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p>What is remarkable though, is that technology is exponential and almost always compounding. To fully dissect that, let me briefly digress. One of the discrete ways I view the levers underpinning civilization is by thinking of government, culture, and technology.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Government constitutes great policy furthering progress, like the religious tolerance of the Ashoka Empire during 268-232 BCE in modern-day India, the birth of direct democracy in 5th century BCE Athens, or the creation of the American Constitution and its numerous checks and balances in 1787.</li>
        <li>Culture constitutes bottom-up change, like the French Revolution in 1789, Iceland's 20-year reversal of youth drug abuse and alcoholism starting in the late 1990s, or the Civil Rights Movement in 1900s America.</li>
        <li>Technology constitutes improved leverage and conditions, like the invention of gunpowder in 9th century CE Tang dynasty China, the creation of the first anatomic textbook in 1543 by Andreas Vesalius, or DARPA's creation of the internet in the 1970s.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Of course none of these categories are mutually exclusive, like Japan's prioritization of elite central planning post World War II (which sits somewhere between lever 1 and lever 2), or the French, English and Dutch governments funding maritime technology and exploration during the 1400s and 1500s (which sits somewhere between lever 1 and lever 3). However, governments and cultures are often lost in transition, while the transfer of technology via documentation is often preserved (Tang dynasty perished while gunpowder survived). This means that over the arc of civilization, technology compounds.</p>

    <p>As for exponentials in tech, just look at the early growth of Facebook, Google, or Tesla. Notoriously, Jim Keller, creator of Apple's A4 Chip, AMD's Zen microarchitecture, and about the most worshipped name in the chip design community, will scrap a project if there is another technology available with a faster growth curve. Elon Musk is similar in his approach. This is a deeply difficult business decision to make: after sinking millions of dollars and months of time, you consciously pull the plug on a semi-mature technology only to start off in worse absolute terms on another technology. The only solace is that this new curve has faster acceleration and a higher ceiling. This is the promise of technological exponentials.</p>

    <p>While I believe in this ethos, there are two other technological exponentials that I want to unlock.</p>

    <p>The first is tangible, and something I deeply believe in. While at a conference this past year, a presenter argued that creating low cost robotics and generally available AI tools would enable individuals experiencing difficulties to solve their problems themselves. The recent availability of 3D printers and coding models means this future is imminent. When viewed statically this may not seem like an exponential, but human population growth is innately so (or potentially logistic, up for debate)— this ultimately means that more people will be able to create technology, again scaling exponentially.</p>

    <p>The second is abstract and may never manifest, but tantalizing to dream of. Imagine a scenario where deep learning creates highly accurate material science models. Then imagine when those models discover a substance that can accelerate compute. Or bring the cost of energy closer to zero. The exponentials unlocked in such a situation are truly staggering to comprehend, but may well be the holy grail of achieving ‘the limit’.</p>
